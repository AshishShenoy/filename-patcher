Yes, it's a very creative name. Moving on...


filename-patcher is a tool for batch modifying filenames. This 
tool can be used to insert and remove text from a filename, with 
more features on their way.

This tool has two versions currently, one with a basic script CLI 
and one with a tkinter GUI. A *nix like CLI using Click is on the 
feature waitlist.
